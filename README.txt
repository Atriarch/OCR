This is an optical character recognition program for times new roman font. 

To use the the program, run the OCR.exe. A command prompt will appear, requesting a .bmp file as input. Upon entering, the command line will then ask for an output filename with .bmp appended to the end. If the input bmp file contains uppercase black times new roman text on a white background without overlapping features, the command line will output all the characters that the program ran across. The output .bmp file gives a visual representation of which objects were scanned.
